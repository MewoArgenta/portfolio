		<p>Hello, my name is Wouter and I like challenges. In the picture above you can see me (at the right) and my friend, reaching a mountain pass at 2412m altitude, after walking a steep path in deep snow with at least 15 kilos on our back. And this for at least three hours straight without any pauses.</p>

		<p>Since september 2017 I migrated from a helpdesk to a second line IT function. Getting to know IT and learning to understand some code I felt encouraged to become a developer.
		My first project at work was to build a tool in VBA in Microsoft Word. After this, out of curiousity and because I was convinced it would be a good start to learn to code, I learned the basics of Java. This experience made me decide to take my developing skills a step further which eventually led me to subscribe for the Front-End Web developer nannoodegree.
